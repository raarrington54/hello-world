Exploring TrueOS
Old retired navy guy, also retired for the VA Health Care System, I spend my fun filled day's with my wife, cat and the dog, these days are filled with joy, laughter and the occassion kissing of the foot, for the things I have or have not yet have to apolgize for..heheheh.
I my spare time (not bugging the wife or pestering the pets) I build Historic Wooden Ship Models and crash my computers.
I've used Linux since 2008. If ever I use MicroSoft, It's on a computer that isn't mine.I am now expoloring/learning Unix on TrueOS. I have not found and thing that I wish to do that would require MS and as a result I have quite forgotten how how to tinker with it. However, I find that most Open Source Issues I research much of the information found seems to assume I am VM'ing or Dual Booting MS.
I have come to realize it much better for me to develop some understanding /knowelege of Git
